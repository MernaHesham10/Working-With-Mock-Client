# Working-With-Mock-Client

## Project Overview
- In this project, you'll have the opportunity to demonstrate the skills you've learned in this course, by working with a mock client to practice initial communication stages. You’ll also manage the client by utilizing the project management process through a tool called Trello as well as setting up project milestones.

- Once it’s time to get paid, you’ll be invoicing your clients! Following these steps will get you comfortable with interacting with clients as well as going through a project stage from initial communication to final payment.
